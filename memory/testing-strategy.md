## 2. Testing Approach

### 2.1 Testing Methodology

**Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle for critical components
- Continuous testing throughout development

**Risk-Based Testing:**
- Prioritize testing based on risk assessment
- Focus on critical user journeys and business logic
- Allocate more testing effort to high-risk areas

**Shift-Left Testing:**
- Early testing in development lifecycle
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Developer responsibility for unit and integration tests

## 3. Unit Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Backend Unit Testing

**Framework:** Jest (Node.js) or pytest (Python)

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Business logic functions: 100%
- API controllers: 90%
- Database models: 85%
- Utility functions: 95%
- Overall minimum: 80%

**Testing Patterns:**
```javascript
// Example unit test structure
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userData = { username: 'test', email: 'test@example.com' };
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.id).toBeTruthy();
    });
    
    it('should throw error for duplicate username', async () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

**Mock Strategy:**
- Mock external dependencies (database, APIs)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Create test doubles for complex objects
- Avoid mocking internal business logic

### 3.2 Mobile Unit Testing

**Framework:** Jest with React Native Testing Library or Flutter Test

**Focus Areas:**
- Business logic components
- Data transformation functions
- Offline storage operations
- Location calculation utilities
- Form validation logic

**Testing Approach:**
```javascript
// Example mobile unit test
describe('LocationService', () => {
  it('should calculate distance between two points', () => {
    const point1 = { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 };
    const point2 = { lat: 40.7589, lng: -73.9851 };
    
    const distance = LocationService.calculateDistance(point1, point2);
    
    expect(distance).toBeCloseTo(5.2, 1); // ~5.2 km
  });
});
```

  it('should authenticate user with valid credentials', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send({ username: 'testuser', password: 'password123' })
      .expect(200);
      
    expect(response.body.access_token).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.body.user.role).toBe('agent');
  });
});
```
